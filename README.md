How to create an UberJar using Ant

Using netbeans do these steps

1. Go the Files tab
2. Right Click build.xml
3. Run Target -> Other Targets -> Package for Store

Thru command line I don't know how to do it. My understanding at
the moment is to do something like "ant package-for-store".

Basically, call ant and the target you want run.
